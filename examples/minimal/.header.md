### Example Variable Values

Here is an example of how to define the variable values in your `terraform.tfvars` file:

```hcl
vpc_id                  = "vpc-12345678"
public_subnet_ids       = ["subnet-abcdef01", "subnet-abcdef02"]
private_subnet_ids      = ["subnet-abcdef03", "subnet-abcdef04"]
kong_public_domain_name = "api.example.com"
kong_admin_domain_name  = "admin-api.example.com"
```

Place this `terraform.tfvars` file in the same directory as your Terraform configuration to automatically load these values. Adjust the values as needed to fit your specific environment and requirements.
