### 7. Create a Pull Request

Github has documentation on [creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

To generate changelog, Pull Requests or Commits must have semantic and must follow conventional specs below:

- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `improvement:` for enhancements
- `docs:` for documentation and examples
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for tests
- `ci:` for CI purpose
- `chore:` for chores stuff

The `chore` prefix skipped during changelog generation. It can be used for `chore: update changelog` commit message by example.

## Code Style

Please ensure your code follows the existing coding style and conventions.

## Reporting Issues

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already
reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of our code being used
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment
