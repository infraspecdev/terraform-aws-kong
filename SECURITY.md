# Security

Infraspec takes the security of our software products and services seriously, including all open-source code repositories managed through our organization, [Infraspec](https://github.com/infraspecdev/).

If you find any security vulnerabilities in our open source projects, please report them. We will ensure that your findings are passed along to the appropriate maintainers for remediation.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Infraspec-owned repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public issues, discussions, or pull requests in Infraspec repositories.**

Instead, please send an email to <security@infrapsec.dev>.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

* The type of issue (e.g., hardcoded credentials, open security groups, publicly exposed S3 buckets, insufficient encryption for data at rest, privilege escalation in IAM policies, misconfigured access controls, lack of resource tagging for security audits, or improper handling of sensitive variables)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
